AntTweakBar development library
-------------------------------

AntTweakBar is a small and easy-to-use C/C++ library that allows programmers
to quickly add a light and intuitive GUI into OpenGL and DirectX based 
graphic programs to interactively tweak parameters.

This package includes the development version of the AntTweakBar library 
for Windows, GNU/Linux and OSX, and some program examples (sources + binaries).

For installation and documentation please refer to:

--------------------------------
This is fork of Philippe Decaudin library. I've only added CMakeList.txt for building with CMake. It tested on Windows with Visual Studio 2017.
